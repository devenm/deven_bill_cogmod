Cognitive modeling has many benefits to fields such as psychology and cognitive science. Modeling allows not only the ability to visualize data we collect in a way that allows us to better explain, pattern find, or understand cognitive processes and human behavior, but also to make predictions about how humans will respond or behave in a given scenario. Models can decide what theories and explanations may be worth testing and researching. They also serve as a vital tool for running simulations, which can be very useful especially in cognitive science where it may be difficult to interact with a human brain freely in experiments.
