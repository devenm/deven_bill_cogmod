Drift rate, or the rate of evidence accumulation, should correspond to task difficulty. In this case, the harder task with more information to process ought to result in a slower drift rate. Therefore the difficult condition in the data should be indicated by condition 2. As for convergence and efficiency, the summary does show the r_hat of the data to be less than 1.05, and the sampling efficiency of ess to be greater than 100, which should support its computational faithfulness."
